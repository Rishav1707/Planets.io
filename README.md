This is a react website, made for visualizing different planets easily and so one can compare their size, rotation speed etc.
ThreeJS is used to code out the planets.
To view other planets, clone the project and run:

1) `npm install`

2) `npm run dev`

ThreeJS is an awesome JS Library, good for animations for 3d objects, Try it out by referring to this resource:
