# Planets.io
This is a react website, made for visualizing differnent planets easily and so one can compare their size, rotation speed etc.
ThreeJS is used to code out the planets.
To view other planets, clone the project and run:

1) `npm install`

2) `npm run dev`

Feel free to contribute on this repo, I will be adding some Issues you can solve and build your open sourcing skills as well!
